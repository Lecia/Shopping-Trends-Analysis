**Key Insights Summary**

The combined dashboards from the Shopping Trends project offer a rich, data-driven view of customer behavior, sales performance, and promotional effectiveness. The Sales Summary highlights that total revenue reached R233.1K across 3.9K customers, with states like Montana, Illinois, and California leading in sales. Revenue peaked between January and June, suggesting seasonal buying patterns. Payment methods were evenly distributed, and high spenders showed a preference for Free and Express shipping. Demographic insights reveal that Youth (24,6%) and Adults (38%) are the most valuable segments, with frequent shoppers—especially weekly and monthly buyers—driving consistent revenue. Male customers dominate the base at 68%, and age-based trends remain stable across months, offering reliable targeting opportunities.

On the promotional and product side, the dashboards show that promo code usage increased steadily, with May and June seeing the highest engagement. Over 57% of customers did not use discounts, and categories like Dresses, Blouses, and Jewelry performed well even when discounted, indicating strong price sensitivity. Product preferences leaned toward neutral colors like Black, Silver, and Gray, with larger sizes (L and XL) generating the most revenue. Clothing and Accessories consistently outperformed other categories, especially in the first half of the year. These insights provide clear guidance for inventory planning, marketing strategy, and customer segmentation—helping businesses align offerings with consumer demand and maximize revenue impact.
